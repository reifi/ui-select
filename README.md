# AngularJS ui-select 

Adapted from angular-ui https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select

# Differences from angular-ui

* Preselection independent from data in repeat
* new attribute 'on-add' callback function attribute for adding new entries to selection by ENTER key
* new attribute 'input-id' to pass id to underlying input field to support form labels

# Roadmap

* -inputId- done
* -add new entries- done

# Far Roadmap
* make it work with extjs like stores and proper selection model
